        1 Avila Tile did an amazing job at my home. After being burned by a past
        floor company, Cristian came in and took over. His attention to detail
        and craftsmanship is of high quality and value. We also had an older
        home with awkward sizes, as well as cusom tile work we wanted to do. He
        is open to feedback while also giving professional advice and guidance
        on the job. Highly highly recommend and will hire again in the future!

        Chris and Carlos brought every professional quality to the project one
        could ask for. As one who worked in construction for many years, I could
        evaluate Avila's performance on every level and can confidently
        recommend them for any tile project.

        Avila tile did an exceptional job with our bathroom and shower. They use
        schluter materials, so they're able to build a curbless shower, and they
        used their ditra underlayment to make the tile the same height as the
        wood floors. They coordinated well with the other trades on the job, and
        they were incredibly precise. They made sure things were straight and
        level first, rather than using a quick fix.


        They would communicate with us daily on the project progress, and sent
        pictures.


        I would heartily recommend their services. If you want to get it right,
        using modern methods, I would use them in a heartbeat.

        I really wish I could have picked more than 3 items to rate Avila tile
        on. I would give Christian and his team 10 stars!! I was my own general
        contractor on my bathroom remodel, and I'm no expert, so it was all very
        stressful. Christian, and his dad Carlos and also Jeorge and Oli were
        all amazing.

        I could tell from the very first time he came out to give me a bid that
        he was the guy I wanted to work with. He was super knowledgeable but
        completely listened to what I wanted and did whatever it took to make
        what I wanted happen. I had others give me bids, but they wanted to do
        what was easier then to actually do what I wanted. Working with
        different plumbers and electrician and cabinet people, Christian worked
        around my schedule which was kind of up in the air half the time. He did
        such an amazing beautiful job on my master bathroom and also on the tile
        work I had done in two other bathrooms.

        Not only did they do all the beautiful tile work but they also did all
        of the demo and rebuilt my tub deck for my new drop in tub.

        Apparently that's not something they do very often but they worked very
        hard and made it perfect. When they were all finished and the glass
        people came to measure for my glass shower doors they were impressed at
        how perfect and square everything was. Unfortunately due to a loss in my
        family I had to be out of town for much of the work and I completely
        trusted Christian and everyone working with him to be in my home when I
        was not there. That's a really big deal to be able to trust people in
        your home. Another thing is that my shower floor is Penny tile and I had
        seen so many pictures online where people installed it wrong and it
        looked so silly. I picked a grout color very close to my penny tile just
        in case, now I wish I had picked a more contrasting grout because he did
        an absolute perfect job. Now that I have taken several showers in that
        shower it's amazing how perfect he angled everything and it all flows
        right to the drain. He completely built the shower floor and also the
        niches in the shower next to the tub. I can't tell you how impressed I
        am with the job that he did! Well I am trying to tell you I am super
        darn impressed!! Now to the money, his bid came in lower than other bids
        yet he did a job that I think is probably worth way more than he
        actually charged! I would recommend Christian with Avila tile to anyone
        and everyone!!! I won't hesitate to use him for any other tile job I
        have! Selfishly I did not want to write a review until my bathroom was
        complete so he wouldn't get too busy
