  text: >-
    As a family-owned business, we know personal service. We put our clients
    first, and that starts with a fair and accurate assessment of your project
    for a quote -- one that is customized on the details of the project, instead
    of simply by a price per square foot. This detailed planning also cuts down
    on changes after the project has begun.

    This level of transparent communication ensures our clients and more smooth
    experience and overall level of professionalism that can’t be matched. Not
    only do we strive to understand and perfectly execute the exact vision you
    have in mind – we treat your home with the same respect and care as if it
    was our own.

    Because at the end of the day, there’s nothing we enjoy more than the pride
    of a job well done.

        1 Avila Tile did an amazing job at my home. After being burned by a past
        floor company, Cristian came in and took over. His attention to detail
        and craftsmanship is of high quality and value. We also had an older
        home with awkward sizes, as well as cusom tile work we wanted to do. He
        is open to feedback while also giving professional advice and guidance
        on the job. Highly highly recommend and will hire again in the future!

        Chris and Carlos brought every professional quality to the project one
        could ask for. As one who worked in construction for many years, I could
        evaluate Avila's performance on every level and can confidently
        recommend them for any tile project.

        Avila tile did an exceptional job with our bathroom and shower. They use
        schluter materials, so they're able to build a curbless shower, and they
        used their ditra underlayment to make the tile the same height as the
        wood floors. They coordinated well with the other trades on the job, and
        they were incredibly precise. They made sure things were straight and
        level first, rather than using a quick fix.


        They would communicate with us daily on the project progress, and sent
        pictures.


        I would heartily recommend their services. If you want to get it right,
        using modern methods, I would use them in a heartbeat.
