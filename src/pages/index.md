    What makes [Company Name] different? In short, it’s our dedication to the
    details. Like a detective with a magnifying glass, we don’t miss anything
    important – no matter how small. Unfortunately, all tiling companies are NOT
    the same in this regard. Paying attention to “details” like using the
    correct waterproofing membranes, understanding the differences between types
    of thin set for different tile sizes and materials, and ensuring the most
    appropriate installation methods for the type of subfloor you have – these
    things are not common. That’s why, with [Company Name] you’ll ultimately
    save both time and money by having your job done right the first time,
    resulting in something that is both beautiful and practical for many years
    to come. Schedule a Free Estimate

        1 Avila Tile did an amazing job at my home. After being burned by a past
        floor company, Cristian came in and took over. His attention to detail
        and craftsmanship is of high quality and value. We also had an older
        home with awkward sizes, as well as cusom tile work we wanted to do. He
        is open to feedback while also giving professional advice and guidance
        on the job. Highly highly recommend and will hire again in the future!

        Chris and Carlos brought every professional quality to the project one
        could ask for. As one who worked in construction for many years, I could
        evaluate Avila's performance on every level and can confidently
        recommend them for any tile project.

        Avila tile did an exceptional job with our bathroom and shower. They use
        schluter materials, so they're able to build a curbless shower, and they
        used their ditra underlayment to make the tile the same height as the
        wood floors. They coordinated well with the other trades on the job, and
        they were incredibly precise. They made sure things were straight and
        level first, rather than using a quick fix.


        They would communicate with us daily on the project progress, and sent
        pictures.


        I would heartily recommend their services. If you want to get it right,
        using modern methods, I would use them in a heartbeat.
