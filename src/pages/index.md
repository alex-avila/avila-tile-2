        1 Avila Tile did an amazing job at my home. After being burned by a past
        floor company, Cristian came in and took over. His attention to detail
        and craftsmanship is of high quality and value. We also had an older
        home with awkward sizes, as well as cusom tile work we wanted to do. He
        is open to feedback while also giving professional advice and guidance
        on the job. Highly highly recommend and will hire again in the future!

        Chris and Carlos brought every professional quality to the project one
        could ask for. As one who worked in construction for many years, I could
        evaluate Avila's performance on every level and can confidently
        recommend them for any tile project.
